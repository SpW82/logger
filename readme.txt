The same program in two different forms.
log_local logs all pressed keys to a local file.
log_client works with log_listener to monitor keyboard input and "on press" of a key, the key 'value' is sent to an IP
address on a specified port to a waiting server, that logs the data to a local file.
Use only on systems that you have permission to.
